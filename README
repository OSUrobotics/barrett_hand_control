This package contains simulation of the barrett arm and barrett hand.

If you want to align manually.

Create a directory /home/(user)/csvfiles

copy make_dir.py from barrett_hand_control in /home/(user)/csvfiles (this file creates a directory in proper format taking input object number and subject number)



Run:
1) roscore
2) rosrun grasp_manager replay_extraction ( enter object number and subject number )
3) Go to csvfiles directory and run: python make_dir.py. Enter same object number and subject number
4) Now go to newly created directory and run: rosrun grasp_manager pointcloud_saver
5) close everything


Now open barrett_control.py in vim and use :%s/saurabh/(your PC-username)/g

Now you are good to go

2) rosrun grasp_manager replay_extraction
3) rosrun rviz rviz (use the grasp_rgb image )
